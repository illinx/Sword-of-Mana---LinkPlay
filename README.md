# Sword of Mana - LinkPlay
Patch that re-enables the disabled linkplay option in Sword of Mana

v1.1 (currently in testing folder). Re-enables BGM on the Host when playing 2PLAYER MODE. Client has SFX but no BGM. This is the first release which includes my own gameplay changes that go beyond recovering what was on the ROM and tries to fix bugs and improve the experience. If you want to play what was shipped in the ROM, stick to 1.0.

v1.0 - "2PLAYER MODE" is now a 4th option on the main menu. It will become visible when the user has a save file on the cartridge, like "CONTINUE" and "COMMUNICATION". The gameplay is otherwise identical to what was hidden on the cartridge. There is no BGM on either Client or Host in this version, as was common in GBA link cable games. Amigo trading functionality remains on "COMMUNICATION" menu

PROTOTYPE release (in old versions folder) - This is a simple 2-byte patch which redirects the "COMMUNICATION" menu from Amigo trading to 2Player Mode. It is the smallest possible patch that will enable the 2Player mode that is hidden in the ROM, however it blocks Amigo trading.
