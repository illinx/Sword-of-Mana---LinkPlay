# Sword of Mana - LinkPlay
Patch that re-enables the disabled linkplay option in Sword of Mana

Currently, this works by re-routing the Communication menu to do Link Play instead of Amigo trading, so Amigo trading is inaccessible in this version.

Hopefully I can add support for both at the same time soon.
